# Multi Purpose Neural Network
## About

This program allows the user to create a neural network of any size and shape, train it, and use it.
The number of layers, neurons, learning rate, number of epochs... are customizable.
The user can choose the activation function for each layer. If the function has not been implemented yet, it can easily be done by computing the function and its derivative.
The input data for training and testing has to fit the Dataset class. Hence only numerical values.

## Usage
The program needs three arguments: the training file path, the testing file path, and the number of output neurons/solution columns.
Files should be in the `CSV` format, and the output neuron results should be placed at the beginning on the left.
The neural network performs better if the data are normalized before usage. `x_norm: (x - x.min()) / (x.max() - x.min()))`.
To denormalize the data `x`: `x_norm * (x.max() âˆ’ x.min()) + x.min()`.

## Iris Data set
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.
Hence the need for a multiperceptron, with at least one hidden layer.
