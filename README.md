# NeuralNetwork
This program allows the user to create a neural network of any size and train it.
The number of layers and neurons is configurable, as is the learning rate and the number of epochs.
The user can choose the activation function for each layer. If the function has not been implemented yet, it can easily be done by computing the function and its derivative.
Same thing for the error function. For now, the sigmoid function and the squared error are used.
The input data for training and testing has to fit the Dataset class.
If it is impossible, some minor changes in the Dataset and NeuralNetwork code should allow the new data to be processed.
